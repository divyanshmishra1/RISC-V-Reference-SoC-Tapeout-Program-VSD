## 📅 Week 1 — Digital Logic & RTL Fundamentals

**Objective:**
Explore the basics of digital design and RTL concepts.

**Focus Areas:**

* Logic gates and combinational circuits
* Sequential design and timing basics
* RTL design flow introduction

📘 *Detailed log:* [Week 1 – Coming Soon](Week_1/README.md)
